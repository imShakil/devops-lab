# Deploy ReplicaSet in Kubernetes Cluster

The Nautilus DevOps team is gearing up to deploy applications on a Kubernetes cluster for migration purposes. A team member has been tasked with creating a ReplicaSet outlined below:

- Create a ReplicaSet using httpd image with latest tag (ensure to specify as httpd:latest) and name it httpd-replicaset.
- Apply labels: app as httpd_app, type as front-end.
- Name the container httpd-container. Ensure the replica count is 4.

## Steps

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
    name: httpd-replicaset
    labels:
        app: httpd_app
        type: front-end
spec:
    replicas: 4
    selector:
        matchLabels:
            app: httpd_app
            type: front-end
    template:
        metadata:
            labels:
                app: httpd_app
                type: front-end
        spec:
            containers:
            - name: httpd-container
              image: httpd:latest
```
