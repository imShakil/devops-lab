# Setup Cronjob in Kubernetes Cluster

The Nautilus DevOps team is setting up recurring tasks on different schedules. Currently, they're developing scripts to be executed periodically. To kickstart the process, they're creating cron jobs in the Kubernetes cluster with placeholder commands. Follow the instructions below:

- Create a cronjob named datacenter.
- Set Its schedule to something like `*/4 * * * *`. You can set any schedule for now.
- Name the container cron-datacenter.
- Utilize the nginx image with latest tag (specify as nginx:latest).
- Execute the dummy command echo Welcome to xfusioncorp!.
- Ensure the restart policy is OnFailure.

## Steps

It's basically `kubernetes job` kind.

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: datacenter
spec:
  schedule: "*/4 * * * *"
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
          containers:
          - name: cron-datacenter
            image: nginx:latest
            command: ["echo", "Welcome to xfusioncorp!"]
```

## Countdown Job

- Create a job named countdown-xfusion.

- The spec template should be named countdown-xfusion (under metadata), and the container should be named container-countdown-xfusion

- Utilize image debian with latest tag (ensure to specify as debian:latest), and set the restart policy to Never.

- Execute the command sleep 5

```yaml
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: countdown-xfusion
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: countdown-xfusion
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Never
      containers:
      - name: container-countdown-xfusion
        image: debian:latest
        command: ["sleep", "5"]
```
