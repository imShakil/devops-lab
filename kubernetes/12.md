# Deploy Highly Available Pods with ReplicationController

The Nautilus DevOps team is establishing a ReplicationController to deploy multiple pods for hosting applications that require a highly available infrastructure. Follow the specifications below to create the ReplicationController:

- Create a ReplicationController using the `httpd` image with `latest` tag, and name it `httpd-replicationcontroller`.
- Assign labels `app` as `httpd_app`, and `type` as `front-end`. Ensure the container is named `httpd-container` and set the `replica count` to `3`.

All pods should be running state post-deployment.

> Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is configured to operate with the Kubernetes cluster.

## Steps

1. Create a replicaton controller yaml file `rc-k3s.yml` using this [contents](./replication-controller.yml)
2. Create the replication controller

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f rc-k3s.yml
    ```

3. Verify

    ```sh
    kubectl get rc
    kubectl get pods
    ```
