# Deploy Applications with Kubernetes Deployments

The Nautilus DevOps team is delving into Kubernetes for app management. One team member needs to create a deployment following these details:

- Create a deployment `named nginx` to deploy the application `nginx` using the image `nginx:latest` (ensure to specify the tag)

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host is set up to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.

## Steps

1. Create `nginx.yml` file with following contents:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
    name: nginx
    labels:
        app: nginx-app
    spec:
    replicas: 1
    selector:
        matchLabels:
        app: nginx-app
    template:
        metadata:
        labels:
            app: nginx-app
        spec:
        containers:
            - name: nginx
            image: nginx:latest
            ports:
                - containerPort: 80
    ```

2. Run the deployment

    ```sh
    kubectl apply -f nginx.yml
    ```

3. Check results

    ```sh
    kubectl get deployments.apps
    kubectl get pods
    ```
