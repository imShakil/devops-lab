# Process Limits

In the Stratos Datacenter, our Storage server is encountering performance degradation due to excessive processes held by the `nfsuser` user. To mitigate this issue, we need to enforce limitations on its maximum processes. Please set the maximum process limits as specified below:

- Set the soft limit to `1024`
- Set the hard limit to `2024`

## Steps

Login into storage server and run the following commands

```sh
sudo cp /etc/security/limits.conf /etc/security/limits.conf.bak
sudo vi /etc/security/limits.conf
```

> Add these two lines at the end of file:

```conf
nfsuser soft nproc 1024
nfsuser hard nproc 2024
```
