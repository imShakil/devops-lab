# Timezone Adjustment

In the daily standup, it was noted that the timezone settings across the Nautilus Application Servers in the Stratos Datacenter are inconsistent with the local datacenter's timezone, currently set to Africa/Dakar.

> Synchronize the timezone settings to match the local datacenter's timezone (Africa/Dakar).

## Steps

Login into each app server and run the following commands:

```sh
sudo timedatectl list-timezones
sudo timedatectl set-timezone Africa/Dakar
sudo timedatectl
```
