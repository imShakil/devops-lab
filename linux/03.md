# Set Permission On Crontab for Users

In alignment with security compliance standards, the Nautilus project team has opted to impose restrictions on crontab access. Specifically, only designated users will be permitted to create or update cron jobs.

Configure crontab access on App Server 2 as follows: Allow crontab access to kareem user while denying access to the ryan user.

## Steps

1. Create allow file:

    ```sh
    sudo vi /etc/cron.allow
    ```

    > Add allowed users in this file:

    ```txt
    root
    kareem
    ```

2. Create deny file:

    ```sh
    sudo vi /etc/cron.deny
    ```

    > Add denied users in this file

    ```txt
    ryan
    ```

3. Restart crond service:

    ```sh
    sudo systemctl restart crond
    ```
