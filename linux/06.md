# Firewall-cmd 

The Nautilus system admins team has rolled out a web UI application for their backup utility on the Nautilus backup server within the Stratos Datacenter. This application operates on port 5004, and firewalld is active on the server. To meet operational needs, the following requirements have been identified:

> Allow all incoming connections on port 5004/tcp. Ensure the zone is set to public.

## Steps

Login into backup server and run the following commands:

```sh
sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=5004/tcp --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
```
