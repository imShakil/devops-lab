# Setup Run Level (Default GUI Boot Configure)

With the installation of new tools on the app servers within the Stratos Datacenter, certain functionalities now necessitate graphical user interface (GUI) access.

Adjust the `default runlevel` on all App servers in Stratos Datacenter to enable GUI booting by default. It's imperative not to initiate a server reboot after completing this task.

## Steps

Run the following commands on all app servers:

```sh
sudo systemctl get-default
sudo systemctl set-default graphical.target
sudo systemctl start graphical.target
sudo systemctl status graphical.target
sudo systemctl get-default
```
