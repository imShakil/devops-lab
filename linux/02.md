# Execute Permission

After conducting a security audit within the Stratos DC, the Nautilus security team discovered misconfigured permissions on critical files. To address this, corrective actions are being taken by the production support team. Specifically, the file named /etc/resolv.conf on Nautilus App 2 server requires adjustments to its Access Control Lists (ACLs) as follows:

1. The file's user owner and group owner should be set to root.
2. Others should possess read only permissions on the file.
3. User mark must not have any permissions on the file.
4. User eric should be granted read only permission on the file.

## Steps

1. Login into App server
2. Set owner and group to `root`:

    ```sh
    sudo chown root:root /etc/resolv.conf
    ```

3. Set others `read only`:

    ```sh
    sudo chmod o=r /etc/resolv.conf
    ```

4. Remove all permission for user `mark`

    ```sh
    sudo setfacl -m u:mark:--- /etc/resolv.conf
    ```

5. Give user `eric` read-only permission:

    ```sh
    sudo setfacl -m u:eric:r-- /etc/resolv.conf
    ```

6. Verify Results:

    ```sh
    ls -la /etc/resolv.conf
    getfacl /etc/resolv.conf
    ```

    ```shell
    [root@stapp02 ~]# ls -la /etc/resolv.conf
    getfacl /etc/resolv.conf
    -rw-r--r--+ 1 root root 69 Aug 11 05:26 /etc/resolv.conf
    getfacl: Removing leading '/' from absolute path names
    # file: etc/resolv.conf
    # owner: root
    # group: root
    user::rw-
    user:mark:---
    user:eric:r--
    group::r--
    mask::r--
    other::r--
    ```
