# How do REST and MQTT differ in real-time communication?

- REST: stateless, client-server model, suitable for CRUD APIs.

- MQTT: lightweight pub/sub protocol, ideal for real-time, low-bandwidth environments like IoT.

Use MQTT when low latency and continuous messaging are needed, e.g., sensors or real-time device updates.
